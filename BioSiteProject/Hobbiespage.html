    <h4><b>Inspiring Words</b></h4>
    <hr />

    <p class="end">
      A career as a nurse is inspiring. Nurses hold humility and concern in their everyday work.<br /> With life there are challenges, but to be able to help others in the midst of those challenges is a superpower. Being a nurse, and saving the life of just hundreds, causes thousands of lives to be positively affected. Families' burdens are lifted, and worries leave. <br />Nurses work with patients of all ages and demographics. Nurses are considerate and must pay attention to the details of the patients' emotions, symptoms, and their interactions with others. The intelligence of a nurse can be unmatched. Symptoms and diagnosis can vary based on the age, race, and gender of a patient. <br />It is also inspiring how much knowledge a nurse gains while in the occupation. After a while, nurses can spot a sickness or help diagnosis with a short consultation. Nurses continue their occupation after hours as well. Nurses even commit to servicing the people around them outside of work, by administering CPR. Being a nurse and an event planner are two occupations one would not think would go together, but both assist with helping people. Both occupations assist with setting a plan with the patient or guest in mind. Nurses assist with setting a plan to help the patient reach better health and an event planner assists with setting a plan based off the vision of the guest/customer. Tamara has chosen careers that allow her to show her care, concern, and passion for others.
